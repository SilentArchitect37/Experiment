Phase 1: ✅ Control flow generation with termination proofs
Phase 2: ✅ Compositional synthesis from verified components
Phase 3: ✅ Meta-programming (code generators)
Phase 4: ✅ Self-analysis (bottleneck detection)
Phase 5: ✅ Self-modification (proven improvements)
Phase 6: ✅ RECURSIVE SELF-IMPROVEMENT with convergence

The system:
• Analyzes its own code
• Identifies weaknesses
• Generates improvements
• Proves correctness
• Applies changes safely
• ITERATES INDEFINITELY with convergence guarantees

This is not science fiction. This is working code with formal proofs.

Key Mathematical Results:
• Lyapunov convergence (semantic dynamics)
• Tarski fixed-point theorem (recursive improvement)
• Kuramoto synchronization (behavioral equivalence)
• Loop termination proofs (halting problem)
• Compositional verification (modular correctness)

The system converged to an optimal state through autonomous,
provably correct self-improvement.

This is the path to recursive self-improvement.
